# React-Redux---Projects

This is a compilation of projects that I am making to learn React with Redux.


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Git bash || Terminal || Git gui client i.e. GitKraken
Also will need Node with NPM to install the dependencies after cloning the repo - https://nodejs.org/en/
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Cloning the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/Brian-Dennis/React-Redux---Projects.git
```

Change the directory to the project you wish to view

```
cd React-Redux---Projects/YouTubeClone
```
Or
```
cd React-Redux---Projects/bookInfo
```

After Running `git clone https://github.com/Brian-Dennis/React-Redux---Projects.git` you should see it clone the repository in the
specified location you declared within your terminal || Git Bash
```
Brians-MacBook-Pro:Python_Projects briandennis$ git clone https://github.com/Brian-Dennis/React-Redux---Projects.git
Cloning into 'React-Redux---Projects'...
remote: Counting objects: 49, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (38/38), done.
remote: Total 49 (delta 4), reused 49 (delta 4), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (49/49), done.
```

## Running Locally

After cloning the compilation of projects you will want to cd into the directory of the project you wish to visit I will use
the YouTubeClone project as the example of how this is done.
```
Brians-MacBook-Pro:React-Redux---Projects briandennis$ ls
YoutubeClone	bookInfo
Brians-MacBook-Pro:React-Redux---Projects briandennis$ cd YouTubeClone
Brians-MacBook-Pro:YouTubeClone briandennis$ 
```
In the above example I ran `ls` to list all directories in the current working directory.<br>
I then saw that I wanted the YouTubeClone Project so I ran `cd YouTubeClone`
